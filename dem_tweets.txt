President Trump and GOP in Congress made it legal for big companies to sell your personal info to third parties. Sound like a terrible idea?
Led effort w Rep. Peterson, @RepTimWalz &amp; @alfranken urging Administration to support MN dairy farmers by enforcing trade laws w Canada.
But it does raise this question: if you‚Äôre helping big companies at the expense of the people who voted for you, then who do you work for?
It's more than a terrible idea. It's a blatant giveaway to big corporations and another move in the GOP's plan to undermine #netneutrality.
