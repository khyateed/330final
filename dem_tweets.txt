This is a nice wee heartwarming story to kick off your long weekend. https://t.co/gCNmDDpoRT
Watched Gone Girl for the first time there. Unsettling start to the long weekend, but a cracking film. (Didn't read the book, mind you.)

@deaco2000 I'll jump on it this weekend then. I like games that actually take your decisions on board
@gavedgar Totally. The way it handles branching narrative and dialogue choices is great. Definitely worth your time.
@deaco2000 yes...So sorry!!!
Fun fact: I've been mistaken for the US senator Joe Donnelly three times in the last few months. Some people are not happy with him.
@deaco2000 Sounds good, love a good story
@HermaKarr Hi there, I think you may be confusing me with the US senator of the same name? I write about videogames for a living :)
@gavedgar Aye mate, it's so good. Some of the best storytelling around.
@deaco2000 It's vegetating in my steam library, worth dusting it off then?
@deaco2000 Are you going to have town halls and listen to people who need health insurance more than insurance co.s need more profit?
@deaco2000 Worth noting that I've already played it through from start to finish twice already.
Nipped back into Oxenfree to quickly check something earlier and sank an hour and a half into it. Such a great game.
Elite: Dangerous' "The Commanders" update brings multi-crew co-op features &amp; much more!
