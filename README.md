Congress Members on Twitter

The idea for this project was motivated by my own interest in politics and how people talk about politics on social media and the internet. My program allows the user to input a keyword that they would like to search on twitter. A cache of all US Senatorsâ€™ tweets is then parsed for the keyword, and the count frequency is recorded. This count frequency is then displayed on a plot, displaying how many times Republican vs. Democratic senators have tweeted the given keyword.
